Because we've all crammed for exams and prayed for miracles - this app predicts your chances.

# Student Score Predictor 💫

Ever stared at your textbook, studied all night, and still wondered — *"What score will I even get?"*  
Well, wonder no more. This cute little web app was built to give you a glimpse into your exam fate (with some real machine learning, not tarot cards).

## About the Project
Made by a student, for students — this app predicts exam scores based on hours studied. It's a beginner-friendly machine learning project wrapped in a soft UI and good intentions.

I created this to:
- Practice ML concepts
- Build something real
- Add sparkle to my portfolio
- Help others who are just starting

## Features
- Predicts your score with just your study hours
- Add your subject + total marks for personalized vibes
- Clean, minimalist interface.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- My ✨ambition✨

## Try it out
(Will update link once deployed!)

## About Me
Hi! I’m Hiba — a curious CS undergrad who’s learning to build, break, and fix things in the world of code.  
This is just the beginning of my dev diary — follow along on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hiba-castellan) if you want to see what I create next! 

## Dreams (aka Future Features)
- Add student feedback suggestions
- Track learning patterns
- Make it prettier (because aesthetics matter, duh)
